**About myself**:
> I work as a deputy director in my own company. We have been engaged in wholesale sales  
> for about 10 years. There was a desire to engage in web development when a website 
> was    needed. I came across the fact that it is very difficult to explain to the 
> developer what kind of website you want. And he began to figure out how it all works. As
> a result, I wanted to change my field of activity, so I came to study at RS School.
